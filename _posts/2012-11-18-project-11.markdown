description: Client required to develop a platform for service providers and consumers. Captain was a platform enabling the service-providers to sell their services (tv-repair, lawn management, and many more) directly to the consumers. I worked in a team to work on these apps (Captain Customer & Captain Partner). For this platform, we had created Android & iOS apps, Website and a Web Admin Portal.

description: Worked in a team to develop a platform for efficient delivery model. Discussed and architected the platform with colleagues in the client's company. Brain-stormed the backend database schema, APIs and the mobile app workflow. I had started work on the consumer frontend app for Android and about 50% was completed when the bureaucracy changed and my contract was terminated from the old company. This platform was supposed to be applied on the auto-rickshaw and the courier service industry in India. I can show the designs, if required.

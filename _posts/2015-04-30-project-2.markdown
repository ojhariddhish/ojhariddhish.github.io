description: Client required my services in one of their projects, mCommerce. It was an ecommerce SDK project. They were planning to develop this sdk which could then support numerous mobile applications. I developed all the UI layouts and integrated their backend APIs along with Facebook & Google+ logins. I also wrote few behaviors for product navigation.
